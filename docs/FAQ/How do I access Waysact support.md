-   Add in new Fundraisers.
-   Delete or retire existing Fundraisers.
-   Change the hours a Fundraiser will work.
-   Add new campaign locations.
-   Add / change Teams and Team setups.
-   Change the Team Leader for a campaign.
-   Create new Teams. 
-   Create and export reports on your campaign/s. 

**When to contact Wayact Support Team**

There are only a few instances where you will need to contact the
Waysact Support Team, such as:

-   Making changes to the creative content used in your campaign.
-   Making changes to your data export template, welcome SMS or welcome
    email.
-   General technical issues.

If you would like to submit a support request or need assistance from
