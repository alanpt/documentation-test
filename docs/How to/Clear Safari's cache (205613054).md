# Clear Safari\'s cache

In many cases, Safari will form data that can make Waysact function in
strange ways. One way to ensure that you have a fresh form to work with
each morning, and whenever your fundraisers are changing iPads from one
another is to clear the browser cache.

If you are using Safari, you can do so by going to the iPad:

1\) Settings page, then

2\) Safari, and finally

3\) Clear history and website data.Â
