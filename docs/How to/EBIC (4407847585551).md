# EBIC

Your Evergiving Business Intelligence Center (EBIC) export can be
connected to your favorite data visualisation tool, such as PowerBI or
Tableau. There is also a free alternative: Google Data Studio. More
information available <https://www.evergiving.com/googledatastudio/> and

As a Charity with multiple suppliers you can set up an identical EBIC in
each supplier's account and blend them using Tableau to have consistent,
unified, real-time reporting across all your face to face fundraising.
As a supplier you can negotiate exactly the data you want your customer
to see - and they don't even need a logon to your account. As a
stakeholder of many accounts globally you can set up an identical EBIC
in each country's account and blend them using Tableau to have
consistent, unified, real-time reporting across the globe.

EBIC will work for Pledge, Lead, Agent and Timesheet exports (only when
locked), but not for Fundraisers. Note when setting up a pledge EBIC,
saved leads will be allowed through unless you add a filter for Record
Type to manually exclude leads.

Through
[#7823](https://github.com/waysact/evergiving/issues/7823){target="_self"}
for EBIC and automated exporters, a new feature will pause them when
they aren\'t being used (where a file is generated from an automatic
exporter and it isn\'t accessed before it expires 5 times or where an
EBIC database isn\'t queried in 90 days). Users can click \"Unpause\" to
restart the export.

The first time you run the EBIC schema it will 'fill' your database.
This might take a few minutes or even hours depending on the complexity
and amount of data you've selected. Once filled the database will
subsequently be updated in real-time with data according to Conditions
you select.

The following fields aren\'t available to EBIC:

1.  supporter firstname and lastname
2.  supporter BSB and bank account number
3.  supporter BIC and Swift
4.  supporter credit card number and cardholder name
5.  supporter phone number, mobile phone number and email address
6.  supporter postal address except for the city and postcode and
    country
7.  All Children fields
8.  Secondary and Tertiary addresses except for the city and postcode
    and country
9.  Secondary/tertiary personal details
10. All instant payment details (e.g. transaction ID)
11. Supporter date of birth (age at date of creation is allowed)
12. Private notes

**Setup tips:**

Best to avoid capitals and spaces in the column headings for Google Data
Studio and some others - they can be quite pedantic. If one change is
made after all the data has been accessed, the tables will all refill
which can take a while.

Through
[#7364](https://github.com/waysact/evergiving/issues/7364){target="_self"}
we added agent and team hours and through
[#7363](https://github.com/waysact/evergiving/issues/7363){target="_self"}
we include agent and call data, with times in format hh:mm:ss (at this
stage only for Account ANOTHER and #510 only) :

-   Pause
-   Preview
-   Dial
-   Talk
-   Wrap

And their preset calculations

-   Agent hours
-   Time on record (there\'s currently no source of
    `Campaign (Time on Record)`. Use the following JS instead:
    `return pledge.campaign.name;` (or `return pledge.campaign.id;`)
-   Call time
-   To include the date of the exported timesheet, use
    `return pledge.date`

Through <https://github.com/waysact/evergiving/issues/8810> we allowed
the following sources through Timesheet EBICs

pledge.agent_preview_time_in_seconds\
pledge.agent_dial_time_in_seconds\
pledge.agent_talk_time_in_seconds\
pledge.agent_wrap_time_in_seconds\
pledge.user_is_agent

 

**NOTE - EBIC has been turned off in production in ANOTHER (Account 3)
so don\'t try to create an EBIC there.**

 

# Errors and database fill

There is now a progress bar in each EBIC schema that shows the
percentage of database that has been filled. It will also show an error
reference if there is an error (for example

# External Setup

For Google Data Studios and Tableau, you just select Add Data Source -\>
PostgreSQL and then enter the connection details as displayed in the
EBIC Schema in Evergiving.

For Data Studios, when you select Enable SSL you\'ll need to upload the
certificates and keys found here
<https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7samy1sucl61g7l/AAAgfXywsolf4eVcw4P1V7u-a?dl=0>
then click on Authenticate, select the \"Data\" table and click
\"Connect.

PowerBi (which doesn\'t work on Macs) has a more complex setup:

-   Install the driver required for PostgreSQL: Download and install the
    latest version of ODBC driver from
    https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/msi/
-   Create a new Data source name (DSN) Run odbcad32.exe (installed by
    default with Windows). If you don\'t know how to find it, type
    \"ODBC\" in the start menu and click on \"ODBC Data Source\"
-   In the User DSN tab, click on Add and select PostgreSQL Unicode and
    click on Finish. Enter the credentials from your EBIC schema. Don\'t
    forget to select \"require\" for SSL Mode. Save and note the name of
    the DSN (Data Source) and Click on Save. Open PowerBI and click on
    Get Data.
-   Select ODBC as source and click on connect. Select the DSN name that
    you created in the previous step. Enter the username and password
    one more time, and click on Connect. Open the table \"data\" in the
    sub-folder, and confirm in the preview that you can see the data.
    Click on the preview and click on Load at the bottom. On the right
    side of the screen, the columns will appear in the \"Fields\"
    section. Select a column to start creating a chart. You can now
    create your dashboard!
