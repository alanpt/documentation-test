# Create users by API

I want to create and retire Agents via API and create teams via API, so
that I can use external scheduling and HR systems to manage the large
volumes of users and teams that I have.

Documentation has been updated on creating a team
<https://waysact.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/create-team,> and creating
an agent / fundraiser
<https://waysact.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/create-agent-or-fundraiser>
or retiring an agent / fundraiser
<https://waysact.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/retire-agent-or-fundraiser>

 

As a part of this change, `supporter_data_api`{.notranslate} users have
now been granted permission to create Fundraiser and Agent users
