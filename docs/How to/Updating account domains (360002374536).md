# Updating account domains

If you do this, it is imperative that :

1.  All users log out of Waysact and Evergiving before any change is
    made.
2.  You update the account domain in the account setup in Waysact.
3.  You edit profiles of each of the Campaign
    Manager/Admin/Manager/Logistics user to update the prefix manually.
4.  Edit each fundraiser user individually afterwards and change
    something (it can be anything) - password is just one of those
    things and is easy to change - fundraisers will receive an SMS with
    their new passwords.

The steps above are based on the legacy app.
