# Add a New Team

**Adding a New Team ** is a very important part of the workflow of the
application. It is designed to be done daily, by anyone with
responsibility for teams. The process assigns a number of hours worked
to each fundraiser; and this allows for payroll reporting as well as an
understanding of effort for reward across teams, campaigns, locations
and any other attribute applied at the team level. Teams are destroyed
every night and must be recreated so as to preserve the integrity of
this reporting.

**1. Add Fundraisers** by simply clicking on them (reload the browser if
you make a mistake)

**2. Configure the team:**

-   The **Campaign** selected will be loaded as the form for the team
    that day
-   The **Campaign Manager** selected will have the results of this team
    added to their results on the Campaign Manager page.
-   The **Team Leader** selected will have the results of this team
    added to their results as a Team Leader on the Team Leader page.
-   The **Timezone** may be adjusted where necessary.

**3. **Pressing **Save** will save the configuration and assign a
default number of hours to each team member (fundraiser).
