# Standard Troubleshooting for iOS

iPads are generally very reliable. Waysact runs in the Safari browser
and this is a stable platform but nothing is infallible. We recommend
performing maintenance on a periodic basis: close all open applications
and ensure the iPad is running the latest version of iOS (General \>
Software Update).

If a fundraiser ever encounters an issue with the iPad, it may be easily
fixed but to save time when contacting us we recommend following these
steps (they\'d be the steps we\'d follow ourselves)

1.  [Close]{.s1} [all]{.s1} open [applications]{.s1} running in the
    background, then reload the browser. That should work.
2.  [Force Safari to
    close](http://support.apple.com/en-au/ht5137){target="_blank"} and
    [Reset](http://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201559){target="_blank"}
    the device. When the device reboots, if there is still an issue then
3.  Test on another iPad. If you still experience the same issue
    please contact support@waysact.com immediately. Please let us know
    the steps to create the issue wherever possible.
