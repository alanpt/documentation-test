# Call Centre - Listen in feature

As an Admin Operations user I want to be able to listen to calls being
made and perhaps join the call, so that I can coach Agents. On the Agent
Overview there is now a column that will display a clickable icon where
the Agent is on a call.\

As an Admin Operations user, where I click the icon I can **listen
only** to the call.

\...then display new buttons where I can speak only to the Agent
