# How much data do I need for Waysact?

Waysact is unlikely to use more than 40 or 50mb per month - it\'s a very
lightweight app that only takes a few hundred kb to download all the
code and a typical form to the browser to start work. Each pledge is at
most 60kb, and there\'s 1024kb per mb. An iPad may be used for other
things though - it\'s a very useful fundraising tool on the street.
These other things can often involve charity creative, imagery and
video, and this is very data hungry. We\'d normally recommend 1GB per
month is sufficient but do check what happens when that limit is reached
and put in place controls appropriately to ensure you don\'t have
issues. Remember Waysact \*can\* work offline but requires an internet
connection to log in.
