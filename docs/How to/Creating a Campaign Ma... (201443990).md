# Creating a Campaign Manager

Adding a Campaign Manager is easy but can only be done by the
*Administrator*. Just navigate to Campaign Managers tab and click on the
'New Campaign Manager' button and enter the following information (which
is mandatory unless noted as optional below):

-   Name
-   Username
-   Email
-   Password
-   Campaign Manager code (optional)
-   Mobile phone number
-   Photo (optional)

**Campaign Manager statuses **

A Campaign Manager can either be Active or Retired. When creating or
editing a Campaign Manager, you can also tick the \'Fundraiser\' box
which will allow the Campaign Manager to also have access to the
Campaign Form and to take Pledges.\
