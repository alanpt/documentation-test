# Dashboards

 

 

 

 

The Fundraiser\'s Dashboard is a page where each Fundraiser can track
their individual results. The information displayed is relevant only to
the person logged in to the app, so Fundraiser\'s do not have access to
each others results. Only the Administrator or Campaign Manager can see
the overall campaign results.

At the top of the Fundraiser\'s Dashboard is an overview of the
statistics on the Pledges they have taken - these can be filtered to
only display certain date ranges.

Below the statistics are 3 sections: the last 3 Pledges taken, the form,
and the \'Swap fundraiser\' section where Fundraisers can change the
user logged in to the app - this is important to accurately record hours
worked and pledges taken. 

At the bottom of the page there is an \'Unsent pledges\' system to show
the pledges collected when the iPad is not connected to the internet.
The next time the iPad is connected to the internet, the Fundraiser just
needs to hit the \'Re-send\' button and these Pledges will then be
processed.

In the top right hand corner of the screen, the Fundraiser\'s name will
be displayed. By clicking on the wheel icon beside the name, the
Fundraiser will be taken to a screen where they can go back to their
Dashboard, view their Logs (total Pledges approved, invalid, cancelled
or alien) or Log book or Logout.

 

 

At the beginning of the campaign, we will set up your dashboard with
information and charts we think will be most useful to you. These will
give you an overview (which can be segmented using the \'filters\' on
the right hand side of the screen) of:

-   Pledges received per campaign / for all campaigns.
-   Average Pledge amount.
-   Donor information such as male / female ratio, average ages, what
    contact details have been received, the percentage of Pledges where
    contact details have been collected, payment types etc.
-   Donation information such as monthly amounts, approved Pledges,
    Pledge status (pending, alien, invalid, cancelled).
-   General information on the Fundraisers working.

If you would like to see other information on your Dashboard, contact
the Waysact Support Team
on [support@waysact.com](mailto:support@waysact.com){target="_blank"} to
see if this is possible.

 

Dashboard filters allow you to interrogate the extensive amount of
information available to you, so that you can quickly access and refine
this information to only see exactly the information you need. 

As each user has different rights to view certain types of information,
the Dashboard will differ per user.

*As the Administrator,* you will have full access to all information
collected. Using the filters on the right hand side of the screen you
can filter by several different filters, such as date range, campaign
name or location, team, fundraiser or pledge status. 

Using the buttons at the top of the screen, you can filter the results
by time - today, yesterday, current week, last week, current month, last
month, current year, last year, and last 12 months. 

*As a Fundraiser,* the top of your Dashboard will display an overview of
the statistics on the Pledges you have taken - these can be filtered to
only display certain date ranges.
