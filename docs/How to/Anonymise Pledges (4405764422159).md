# Anonymise Pledges

You can set pledges to automatically anonymise - head to the Campaigns
section in Evergiving and hover over the campaign name. Select General
Settings and on this page you\'ll see an option \"Anonymise Campaign\'s
Personal Data Automatically\". When you tick that box a drop box will
appear and you can select the number of months from pledge creation that
you want the anonymisation to kick in.

Please note, there is no \"undo\" function - once we remove / anonymise
data, there is no way to retrieve the information. It is permanently
removed so you need to ensure the time schedule set leaves enough time
for all data to be exported to the charity.
