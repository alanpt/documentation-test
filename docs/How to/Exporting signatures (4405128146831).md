# Exporting signatures

You can export the signatures in bulk and there are two methods of
export

1\) Add the \[signature download link\] merge field in the export email.

2)Use the old hard coded signature export:

At the top of the export menu found on the Pledge pagethere are 3 export
types - signatures, attrition and photographs. Eventually these will
likely be removed at some stage as they are the old hard coded exports.

Select Signatures from the Export menu to trigger the signature export
for all of the pledges that match the criteria set in your filters (for
a specific campaign or time range for example).

The export email will be sent to the email address/es in the \"Export
Notification\" section of the campaign setup in Waysact. Clicking the
link will download a zip file containing the signatures and the file
name will be the Pledge ID.

**Anatomy of the Signatures**\
Signatures can be in either PNG (default) or JPG format and have a
naming convention of {PLEDGE_ID}.png. It is possible to add a prefix to
the {PLEDGE_ID}.png so a prefix of \'BLUTH\' might look like
BLUTH451423.png - edit the schema and head to the \"Export Destination\"
section and then update the \"Signature File Name Template\" section
(see 4.5 on this page for more information
<https://support.waysact.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404347585295-Creating-a-pledge-export>).
Signatures have the pledge ID printed on them, including any requested
prefix. Signatures are usually between 50-100kb in size.
