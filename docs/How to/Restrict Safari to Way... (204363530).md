# Restrict Safari to Waysact

You can turn on restrictions on your iPad so that only Waysact (and a
selection of other websites) can be visited using Safari. There is an
added benefit of generating handy bookmarked buttons for quickly
navigating to Waysact.

1.  1.  Enable website
        restrictions: [https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201304](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201304){style="background-color: #ffffff;"
        target="_blank"}
    2.  Please add Waysact in like this:

width="500" height="667"}

 

3\. The outcome (on opening Safari) is that you will see the below icon
only. You can add select sites to this feature, perhaps your
charity\'s or other useful information websites for example.
