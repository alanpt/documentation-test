# Statuses and Validation Outcomes

Waysact can support a wide variety of validation workflows from
sophisticated welcome calling to simple cursory checks. There are
features to record these interactions whatever they might be and to
categorise them.

\
**Status**\
\
All pledges are automatically recorded as being in a Status of Pending.
This means they are pending the result of a validation workflow. The
result of an interaction in a validation workflow typically falls in to
three categories, the pledge is either OK, not OK, or something else\*.
Waysact calls these \'Statuses\' and labels them: \'Approved\',
\'Invalid\', and \'Alien\'.

\
**Validation Outcomes**\
\
Validation Outcomes are simply pre-configured descriptions for why a
pledge is Approved, Invalid or Alien (OK, not OK or something else).
Most customers will have a list of 10-20 Validation Outcomes that is
completely exhaustive of all the outcomes of their typical validation
workflows.

Validation outcomes are a pre-configured list of statements that
describe the result of a manual check of the donor\'s details. They are
configured from the main Pledges page and have automated status changes
(Approved, Invalid etc) and can also have automated *Contact Made*
changes. *Contact Made* may be used to record whether contact was made
with the donor.

\* \'Something else\' (Alien) usually indicates the donor does not meet
minimum criteria for quality required for your face to face fundraising
campaign. It\'s likely this donor will have their payments transacted
but they are neither Invalid nor Approved from the fundraiser\'s
perspective (statuses typically used to reward or otherwise).

You can view the existing Validation Outcomes by going to the Pledges
tab and clicking the \'Validation Outcomes\' button.

You will see a list of outcomes, the automated changes each outcome will
trigger for a Pledge, and whether there is an automated *Contact Made*
change associated with that outcome. For example, if a user selects a
Validation Outcome of \'Bank details provided\' this may trigger an
automated change to the Pledge to set the status to approved and the
Contact Made to \'Yes\'. This automation reduces the manual work for
your team.
