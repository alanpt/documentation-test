2.  Ignore which DNS host, leave blank. Select Yes to rebrand links
    (recommended). Next
3.  Enter domain and click Next. There are Advanced Settings for SPF and
    DKIM but unless asked for, leave them as automated.
4.  Select 'Send To A Coworker' and enter your own email address. You'll
    receive an email, click the link and then manually copy and paste
    the url in to an email to the customer. Ensure to ask them to let
    you know when added; and when they tell you..
5.  Come back to Sendgrid, find the domain and click Verify to test
    they've been added.
