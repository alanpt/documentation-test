# Team Events

**Team Events** can record anything but are usually used to record the
type of face to face fundraising activity a team is engaged in.

Go to Teams \> Team Events \> Add a New Event to add in a few Team
Events.

*Every pledge captured today by Buster, Gerorge Michael, Gob or Maeby
will have Private site saved with the rest of the data!*

 

**Important notes on Team Events:**

If you make more than one Team Event active, one Team Event will be
mandatory.

You can not delete Team Events, only retire them (hide them).

If you change the name of a Team Event you will be changing the name on
every pledge it has been saved with.

Campaign Managers do not have access to edit Team Events, only apply
them to teams.
