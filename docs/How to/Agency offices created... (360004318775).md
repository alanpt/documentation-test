# Agency offices created under the charity\'s account

The Office feature is now available and we are starting to get queries
from charities about setting up agencies as Offices and having the
agency work from within their account.

James\' response to this request :

`It's possible yes, but will have a number of negative consequences for the agency. They will lose visibility across their organisation; lose their ability to manage staff, payroll, training, achievements. They will also lose duplicate checking cross-campaign which monitors for fraud, and a bunch of other things now and in the future. We'd strongly discourage it. On the other hand, your agency can use their own account and give you granular access to their account, restricted to your campaign.`

So it is best to have a conversation with the charity and find out why
and what they are trying to achieve by doing this.

If it's a charity on a special discount and they are wanting to create
an Office for a fee-earning agency, as opposed to a body shop, then
there could be pricing implications that James will need to discuss with
them.
