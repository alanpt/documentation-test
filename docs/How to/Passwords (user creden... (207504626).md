# Passwords (user credentials)

All users should have their own unique login. There are many reasons for
this -- firstly it is a PCI DSS requirement, secondly it is best
practice for data security and thirdly, if there is an issue with the
login (for example, someone has entered an incorrect password and locked
the account) all users who rely on that login will be locked out. Having
unique logins also creates a clear audit trail for changes that have
been made to pledges and accounts in Waysact.

Users with access to donor data (Pledges Tab) passwords must be:

-   a minimum of seven characters in length;
-   contain both numeric and alphabetic characters;
-   be changed every 90 days; and
-   cannot be the same as previous 4 passwords.

Otherwise passwords must be a minimum of six characters.

We would also strongly recommend you to incorporate the following
requirements into your user account management procedures (if you're in
scope for PCI these are 8.1.1, 8.1.2 and 8.1.3 respectively):

-   All users should be assigned a unique login (no sharing)
-   You should have some control or policies concerning addition,
    deletion, and modification of users
-   You should immediately revoke access for any terminated users
-   If you believe your password to be compromised you should reset your
    password immediately.
