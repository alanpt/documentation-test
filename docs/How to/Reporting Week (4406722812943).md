# Reporting Week

If you use **Reporting Weeks **in your operation, we can implement logic
to assign a week to each pledge. Unless custom reporting weeks have been
set up in the Account profile like in the example below, the account
will operate on the default reporting week schedule.

The reporting week can be adjusted via the edit pledge view

and can also be updated via import with other pledge data.

A further issue <https://github.com/waysact/evergiving/issues/7323> will
allow the reporting year value to be updated as well as identifying the
user who imported the update in the Recent Activity
