# What is the Manage Children section?

**Manage Children** is only visible to the administrator user. The
feature is designed to manage the profiles of children waiting to be
sponsored. Where a child profile is given to a new sponsor, the
fundraiser can record the ID on the form and it will be validated
against the list. The child will also then be recorded as sponsored.
