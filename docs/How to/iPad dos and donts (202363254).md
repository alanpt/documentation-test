# iPad dos and donts

Some basic dos and dont\'s for iPad users with Waysact:

**Don\'t**

1.  [Add a Home screen bookmark. It is possible to create a
    Safari bookmark that will launch from a home screen icon (it will
    appear in full screen). There are numerous reasons why this is not
    recommended. From a usability point of view, this mechanism in iOS
    will force a refresh every time the icon is opened meaning you will
    need the app to completely load every time you cycle to another
    application. There are also issues with how iOS manages offline
    storing for bookmarked pages.]{style="font-size: 11px;"}
2.  [Use Private browsing. Private browsing disables the offline storage
    on the app and should not be used.]{style="font-size: 11px;"}

**Do**

1.  [Remember me. Ticking remember me on log in will mean the fundraiser
    won\'t be automatically logged out and the form details will be
    saved if cycling between apps.]{style="font-size: 11px;"}
2.  [Install another browser for surfing the web. Use of Waysact on one
    of multiple tabs within Safari is perfectly acceptable but you might
    consider having another browser (e.g. Chrome) installed for research
    and other web use. ]{style="font-size: 11px;"}
