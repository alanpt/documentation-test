When considering a purchase of new devices, include in Total Cost of
Ownership calculations:

-   Battery life - I think Samsung edges Apple on this, but both better
    than a cheaper android device
-   Antenna - you will need the internet, so quality matters
-   Length of time the device is supported for. To remain secure you
    need the latest version of the operating system, as versions always
    have security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities. That
    means the manufacturer must support the device while you're using
    it. Apple beats Samsung here by a few years. Definitely the winner
    on it's own\...

    and

-   Usability - difficult to quantify.
-   Reliability - both iOS and Samsung have good tools for enterprise
    management, locking devices etc.

-   Our iOS app tracks fundraiser by their deliberate interaction with
    the app - to check in and out of a location etc so that's a benefit
    for iOS at the moment as it isn\'t available on Android devices as
    yet.
-   Cost of a lost donor due to hardware malfunction. I'd estimate the
    life of a device to be between 2-4 years (see point 3), and so if
    you buy a cheap device, and it loses one donor due to malfunction
    (crashes, battery etc) then consider the cost of that donor against
    the difference in cost between the device and the best available.

In terms of capacity, it depends what else they want to use it for, but
our app wouldn't make a dent in any data plan nor storage quota, so they
can go for the smallest available of each.

 

[**Operating System**]{.wysiwyg-font-size-large}

It is now a really high overhead to test on iOS9 but we\'ll do our best
to keep it running for you. At some point that\'ll become too hard, and
I have no idea when that\'ll be.\
\
The A5 chipset in devices up to iOS9 now has hundreds of known security
vulnerabilities, including the leaking of the source code to what starts
the device - fundamental to its security. As a rule of thumb we\'ll
guarantee support for a device that the manufacturer still provides
security updates for, and best endeavours for way past that.\
\
The test however for PCI DSS 6.2 (a) is to have installed the latest
security patches (comes with upgrades) within 3 months:\
• Installation of applicable critical vendor-supplied security patches
within one month of release.\
• Installation of all applicable vendor-supplied security patches within
an appropriate time frame (for example, within three months).\
\
How long the manufacturer provides support for is never known when you
buy them - but Apple do provide support for longer.
