# Track n Snap

**Track n Snap**  is an asset tracking and photo sending/storing iOS app
that records the iPad\'s current owner and location. A new version of
Track n Snap was released in June 2015 so make sure you update your
iPads to the latest version to pick up the new features!

Once logged in to Track n Snap it\'s not possible to log out without
another user logging in - ensuring a chain of ownership for your iPads.
There is no need for a user to sign in/for an iPad more than once,
they will stay logged in/assigned to the iPad until the next user signs
in.

Track n Snap also allows initial offline storage of supporter
photographs when they have not been uploaded at the time of taking (i.e.
if there is no internet connection).

Once your user logs into Track n Snap and gives permission for the app
to access their location, the iPad location will appear in the Asset
Tracking tab against the user\'s name:
