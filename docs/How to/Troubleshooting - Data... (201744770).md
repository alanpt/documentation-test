# Troubleshooting - Data Connection

If you are unable to access the app over a mobile network, try the
following steps.

-   Turn data off completely (switch to flight mode for example) for a
    few minutes and switch back on.

Is mobile data now active?

If not, continue with the following hard reset steps :-

-   Switch off the device and eject the sim card
-   Turn the iPad on (allow it to boot fully)
-   Switch iPad off again - insert Sim Card
-   Switch iPad on and test again.

If there\'s still no connection contact the carrier.

To access the app when no data connection is available, locate a
wireless connection, sign in once and work off line for the rest of the
day.
