# About Pledges

**What is a pledge?** A pledge is created when your form has been filled
in - otherwise known asÂ new sign ups or new donors.

**How do I find a pledge?** To find an individual pledge, simply go to
the Pledges tab and use the filters on the right hand side of the list
of pledges. You can enter the ID number if you know it, otherwise the
partial name of the donor or Fundraiser may be entered. If you don\'t
have this information you can use fields such as the date range the
pledge was created to search on.

**How is *Pledge Created Date* and *Pledge Validated Date* different?**

*Pledge Created Date* is the date the Fundraiser first created the
pledge.

*Pledge Validated Date* is the date the validation outcome was applied.
This is useful for exporting approved pledges from the system as soon as
they are validated.

**How do I use pledge filters?**

On the Pledges tab there is an extensive list of filters that allow you
a simple way to interrogate the pledge information and report on
multiple scenarios. They allow you to segregate the pledge information
by filters such as Campaign, Campaign Manager, donor, Fundraiser,
validation amount, and reporting week.

Pledges can be filtered by any of the filters on the right hand side of
the Pledges tab. You can also narrow the search by selecting a Pledge
Status.

After you have selected the required filters, click the \'Filter\'
button. This will take you to a screen which has an overview of the
results under the heading Statistics at the top of the page and a count
of the pledges matching your filters is displayed under the Results
heading.
