# Can I request new features?

Absolutely! WeÂ are constantly tweaking and improving our app based on
customer requests and feedback. How it works is we\'ll schedule most any
request in to our backlog and we\'ll build it for free. We give no
guarantees whatsoever for timeframe but the better the idea / more value
it provides the app / more customers requesting it the higher up the
backlog it is. We can quote for a solid timeframe, and we\'ll be honest
if we think it\'s something just for you guys and would take ages. That
being said this is an app designed by the industry for the industry and
we\'d expect it to accommodate most of what you need. If there\'s
something key to your business that will assist adoption we\'ll
definitely give that special consideration.
