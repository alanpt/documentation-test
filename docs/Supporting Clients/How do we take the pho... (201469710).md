# How do we take the photo of the donor and how is this attached to an SMS?

Once you submit a pledge a button will appear that opens the Track n
Snap iOS app, takes the photo, saves it and then uploads it to our
servers.\
\
An SMS will be sent to the mobile number provided with up to 100
characters of text, including the {FIRST_NAME} merge tag and a short URL
to the photo.

N.B. you will need to ask for this feature to be enabled for your
campaign.
