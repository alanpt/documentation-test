# Step 1: Adding Manager Users

We recommend this as the first step in configuring your account. Log in
as the Administrator user, using the credentials provided to you by
Waysact (admin@abc.xyz). Navigate to the Users page and click \'New
User\'

The highest level of normal user access, the \'Manager\' is recommended
for account owners and for administrative staff that will need to
interact with and make changes to Pledge data.

To create your first Manager User, fill in the following fields below
marked with an asterisk: (you can ignore the rest for now)

Once you have created your Manager user/s, log out of the Administrator
User and use the new Manager credentials you\'ve created\* to log in.

N.B. every user in your account will have the same suffix to their
username. Michael above works for the Bluth company who have been
assigned \'@bluth.app\' as their account suffix. Michael\'s username
would be automatically generated with this suffix and would log in as
username \'michael@bluth.app\'
