# Editing Campaign Managers

**Deleting / Retiring a Campaign Manager **

it is not possible to completely delete a Campaign Manager. Instead they
are \'retired\' by selecting \'retire\' next to their name. After this,
the user will no longer have access to the system and their name will be
moved to the \'Inactive\' section in the Campaign Manager tab. Their
statistics will be preserved and will be updated as changes are made to
pledges.

**Reactivating a Campaign Manager**

To reactivate a Campaign Manager, go to the \'Inactive\' section on the
Campaign Managers screen and select \'Active\' beside that user\'s name.
The user will then be fully restored and will be moved back to the
\'Active\' tab.

**Updating a Campaign Manager**

To make changes to an existing Campaign Manager, navigate to Campaign
Managers section and click on \'Edit\'  beside the name of the Campaign
Manager you would like to update.

**Campaign Manager Roles**

Campaign Managers can be added as fundraisers so that they can be added
to teams. Once added as a fundraiser they can also have the Campaign
Manager status removed from them, effectively demoting them. Conversely
it is also possible to promote a fundraiser in the same way. This is all
managed via the edit Campaign Manager page:
