to the signature page is stored with the pledge.

**Can I export signatures in bulk?**

Yes. Firstly you must filter the pledges in the Pledges list by
Campaign, applying any extra filter to select the signature/s that you
want to export. Click Export Data at the top of the Pledges page and
then select Signatures.

This will export all of the signatures that are returned by the filters.
An email will be sent to the email address supplied to Waysact by your
Administrator containing a link to download the signatures from:

Clicking the link will download a zip file containing the signatures.

**Anatomy of the Signatures**

Signatures can be in either PNG (default) or JPG formats.

Signatures have a naming convention of {PLEDGE_ID}.png

It is possible to add a prefix to the {PLEDGE_ID}.png so a prefix of
\'BLUTH\' might look like BLUTH451423.png

Signatures have the pledge ID printed on them, including any requested
prefix.

Signatures are between 50-100kb in size

**Can I store signatures in Waysact and just retrieve one when I need
it?**

Yes, and if you only want to access one signature at a time, then you
can use the filters to find the individual and return that single
pledge, then click Export Data and then Signatures.
