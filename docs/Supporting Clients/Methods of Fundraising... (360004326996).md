# Methods of Fundraising and Locations

Methods of Fundraising (previously Team Events) can record anything but
are usually used to record the type or method of fundraising a team is
engaged in - Street, Door to Door, Shopping Centre etc. Locations are
used to record the location the team will be working that day. Both
values are added to the team setup and then every pledge taken by that
team will have the Method and Location saved against them, so they are
useful for reporting purposes. They are both linked to the team, so if
you update the Method of Fundraising or Location on one pledge, all
pledges signed up by that team will also be updated.

Both are created by customers under the Account menu on the *Teams
Settings* page. In the *Minimum Number Required* field, if you enter a
value more than 1 then it will be mandatory to select at least the
amount selected for *Methods of Fundraising* or *Locations* when
creating a Team. Leave as 0 if you do not wish to make them mandatory.
In the *Maximum Number Allowed field*, if you enter a value then it will
not be possible to select more than that value at Team creation.
Selecting 0 here will prevent you from being able to add any on Team
creation.

**Activate and Deactivate**

Click on the eye icon next to a Method of Fundraising or Location to
activate it (it will appear in the list at Team creation) or deactivate
it.

**Delete**

You can only completely delete a Method of Fundraising or Location if it
has never been used. You'll see the bin icon next to records that
haven't been used. Clicking the icon will remove the record completely.

Enter a key (for example \"Location Code\") and the related value (for
example \"SYD1009\") and then press the \"Add\" button. This saves the
key/value data against the Location or Method of Fundraising and this
value is then accessible via the exports.

**Adding Method of Fundraising to a team\
**

Go to the Field menu and on the Teams page, click \"Add a team\" and
here you will see the option to add the Method of Fundraising. If you
update a Method of Fundraising via the edit pledge page then all pledges
in that team will be updated with the new Method. 

**Adding Locations to a team**

There are two different ways locations can be used\
1) Most commonly used option is to go to the Field menu and on the Teams
page, click \"Add a team\" and here you will see the option to add the
Location. If you update a Team Location via the edit pledge page then
all pledges in that team will be updated with the new Method. 

2\) Fundraisers who will be working multiple locations in a day can
select the Location from the fundraiser form (see
<https://github.com/waysact/evergiving/issues/5883>). The Locations
component can be set up with various constraints (see Article
\"Campaigns - Campaign Component Locales\"
