# Call Centre - Users

Â 

Only Admin Operations users can access the Call Centre.

Agent users are created in the Call Centre section on the Agents page.

The Agents overview page lists the active Agents, and it also shows
their current status (logged in, on call etc), the time the last status
changed, the campaign they are assigned to / working on and, when on a
call, the listen in feature.

Filters have been added to the top of the page to segment users by their
status.

There is also an export option for the Agent exports (currently for
Super Admins only)

**Note -** **a** **Call Centre Agent Admin** role was released through
<https://github.com/waysact/evergiving/issues/7201> that gives
read/write access to teams / call lists / inbound calls to a standard
agent user. It doesn\'t include edit access to Agents. You need to be a
full and unrestricted Admin Ops user in order to create a Call Centre
Admin user.
