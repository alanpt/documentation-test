In a few clicks you can now connect Evergiving to Zapier with easily
customised payloads for all sorts of great reasons. Zapier.com is a tool
that connects web applications together. You can do lots of things with
it:

</div>

-   When a pledge is created, send an SMS.
-   When a pledge is approved, post to Teams, Slack or even Facebook
    pages - *\"Woohoo! ðŸŽ‰ Another \$25 a month is going to support
    UNICEF. Well done Jo!\"*
-   At the end of the day, create the donor in your CRM, via their API.
    If it works with Zapier, it\'ll now work with Evergiving.
-   The day after a donor signs up, call them from your external Call
    Center provider.
-   When a donor under 35 years old signs up, send the donor an invite
    to Instagram.
-   \... or any other action like send them a survey, an email from
    mailchimp, or just create a row in a spreadsheet.
