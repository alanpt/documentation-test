# Deleting and retiring users

In each of the sections of the app dedicated to users (Campaign Manager
/ Fundraiser / User tabs) you will see 3 links at the top left hand side
of the page - Active, Inactive, and All. The app is defaulted to display
the active users but you can use the links to view users who are
inactive, or all active + inactive users.

**Deleting and retiring users: **different users have to be dealt with
in different ways and not all users can be deleted.

Manager or Logistics user - to delete either one of these user types,
simply go to the Users tab and select delete against the user. 

Fundraiser or Campaign Manager - it is not possible to delete these
users from the system as this will affect the overall campaign
statistics. Instead they can be \'retired\' by going to either the
Fundraisers or Campaign Managers tabs, and selecting \'retire\' next to
their name. After this, they will no longer have access to the system
and their name will be moved to the \'Inactive\' section in either the
Fundraiser or Campaign Manager tab. Their statistics will be preserved
and will be updated as changes are made to pledges. 

**Reactivating users:**

To reactivate a Fundraiser or Campaign Manager, go to the \'Inactive\'
section on either the Fundraisers or Campaign Managers screens and
select \'Active\' beside that user\'s name. The user will then be fully
restored and will be moved back to the \'Active\' section.
