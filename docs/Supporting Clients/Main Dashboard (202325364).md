# Main Dashboard

The Main Dashboard is the first page any user above a fundraiser sees
when logging in. The Main Dashboard is fully configurable to show real
time stats on the performance and quality of your field. 

Waysact ships with the standard default stats but this can be tailored
to suit your organisation, please raise a support ticket with any
changes you might like to be made. Some examples below.
