# Users who have been locked out

A user will be locked out of Evergiving for a period of 30 minutes when
an incorrect password is entered 6 times in a row. A warning is received
on the 5th incorrect attempt. It appears the system never resets the
\"incorrect attempt count\" unless you do a correct attempt. So if you
do 5 incorrect attempts spread out over a century, it will still lock
you out on the 6th attempt if you haven\'t successfully logged in since
making the other incorrect attempts.

The unlock happens automatically after 30 minutes. If a user reports
being locked out and they can\'t remember their password, they can get
an account administrator to change their password or use the *Forgot
your password* feature on the Evergiving login screen. When prompted the
user needs to enter their username they log into Evergiving with and
we\'ll email a link to reset their password to the email address in
their user profile.
