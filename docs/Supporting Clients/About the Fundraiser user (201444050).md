# About the Fundraiser user

**Retiring a Fundraiser**

it is not possible to delete a Fundraiser. Instead they are \'retired\'
by selecting \'retire\' next to their name. After this, the user will no
longer have access to the system and their name will be moved to the
\'Inactive\' section in the Fundraiser tab. Their statistics will be
preserved and will be updated as changes are made to pledges.

**Reactivating a Fundraiser**

To reactivate a Fundraiser, go to the \'Inactive\' section on the
Fundraiser tab and select \'Active\' beside that user\'s name. The user
will then be fully restored and will be moved back to the \'Active\'
tab.

**Updating a Fundraiser**

To make changes to an existing Fundraiser click on \'Edit\' beside the
name of the Fundraiser you would like to update.

**Fundraiser code**

The fundraiser code is usually used to record some kind of code
associated with that fundraiser. This may reflect an employee or payroll
number, or even a pay grade. Every pledge captured by that fundraiser
will be tagged with the code entered here *at the moment of pledge
capture. *Please N.B. subsequently changing the code will not change the
code assigned to the pledge. This can be done from the edit pledges
page.

**Restrict a fundraiser to a Campaign Manager**

If you choose a Campaign Manager from this list, then no other campaign
manager will be able to setup this fundraiser on a team and assign them
to a campaign.

**Promote a Fundraiser to Campaign Manager**

Fundraisers can be promoted to Campaign Managers so that they can be set
up teams and have those teams\' stats recorded against them as a
Campaign Manager. This is all managed via the edit Fundraiser page:
