# Automatic Exports

The automatic exports feature is a fully configurable engine that picks
data and pushes it to the API endpoint or export file. It can be set to
pick and push whatever data whenever it is required e.g. every x
minutes/hours/days, all new data (or every first Tuesday of November in
a Leap year at 9am UTC, all the pledges with the first name George :).
