# Team Logs

The Team Logs section of Waysact is where the hours are tracked for your
team members. Each day that a fundraiser or campaign manager is assigned
to a team, they will automatically record an entry in the team logs
section with their assigned hours for that day.

If you need to modify a team member\'s hours, you do so by clicking the
edit button to the right of the entry you want to change. You can either
edit their hours directly, or create an absence that subtracts a certain
number of hours from their working hours for some reason.

In order to do this, you will first need to create an \"Absence Reason\"
by clicking the \"Absence Reasons\" button in the top right of the Team
Logs page:

Once there, you can create any absence reason you like.

After you have created the absence reason, you will need to click the
\"Absences\" button to record an entry for the absence of a team member.

On the Absences page, click \"New Absence\" in the right sub-menu of the
page, and complete the form:

Click \"Create Absence\" at the bottom, and that\'s it! You will see the
absence appear on the team member\'s record for that day:
