# Team Labels

**Team Labels** can record anything but are usually used to record the
location of a team.

Go to Teams \> Team Labels \> Add a New Label to add in a few Team
Labels.

*Every pledge captured today by Buster, Gerorge Michael, Gob or Maeby
will have Country Club saved with the rest of the data!*

 

**Important notes on Team Labels:**

You can have as many Team Labels as you like.

You can import a CSV of Team Labels.

If you delete a Team Label you will **not** be deleting it from where it
is already saved with a pledge

If you change the name of a Team Label you will **not** be changing the
name on every pledge it has been saved with.

Campaign Managers do not have access to edit Team Labels, only apply
them to teams.
