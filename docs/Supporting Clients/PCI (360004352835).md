# PCI

Â 

Evergiving is not listed on the Visa PCI compliant service providers
list [http://www.visa.com/splisting/.](http://www.visa.com/splisting/)
The list Visa maintains adds limited value to Evergiving as it would
never be the first place an NGO checks when looking at our service.
Being on a publicly available list also sets us up as a target for any
hackers looking for card information.

Evergiving is a Level 1 PCI Compliant Service Provider and we can supply
our AoC upon request.
