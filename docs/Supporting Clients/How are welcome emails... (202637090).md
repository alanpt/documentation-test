# How are welcome emails sent to supporters?

Waysact have a single dedicated IP with www.sendgrid.com that is
whitelisted so we can[ send emails on behalf of an email address
provided by your charity.]{.s1}

We don\'t require an SPF record as the emails are coming from this
trusted source. We are very careful of maintaining the
highest reputation to maintain whitelisting by:

-   **Very low bounce and invalid rates** - We employ numerous controls
    on the form to ensure email addresses are valid. These include
    disabling copy/paste for email match retyping, using fuzzy logic to
    suggest the user might have misspelled any of the top 100 email
    domains globally (hotmale -\> hotmail); we even send a ping to the
    mail server to check the email account exists. This matters because
    bounced/invalid emails affect our reputation.
-   We ensure the **emails are coded to the latest/highest standards** -
    again this affects deliverability.
-   We **police emails** to ensure there are no further asks, that they
    are purely transactional in nature to prevent any errant spam
    reports.

Waysact send many thousands of individual transactional emails to new
email addresses every day worldwide. We have a delivery rate of 94%
across all our customers as a result of these measures
