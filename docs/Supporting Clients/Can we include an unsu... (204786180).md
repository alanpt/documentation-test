# Can we include an unsubscribe link in our welcome email?

There is no need for an unsubscribe link in a welcome email. The email
is deemed as a transactional confirmation and permission implied by
providing an email address.

The problem with us even attempting to add an unsubscribe link is there
is no database to unsubscribe from when we send the email.

If we\'re provided with an unsubscribe link that to your database so
that when you receive the email address, you know not to send anything
to it, then we can add that link to the email. However, as this first
transactional email is a one off piece of communication, the unsubscribe
request is probably better catered for by options on the form that give
the supporter an opportunity to opt out of email communications beyond
the first confirmation, or through your emails to the donor once you
start regular communication with them.
