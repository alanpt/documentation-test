# What role does the Campaign Manager play?

Sometimes known as Coach, Field Operations or just Manager, a Campaign
Manager is a frontline manager that is responsible for a number of teams
but may also be set up as a Fundraiser in the system.

The results from teams that are set up under a Campaign Manager user are
automatically aggregated and recorded against their statistics.

As you can see from above, a Campaign Manager can also be a
**Fundraiser**, a **Team** **Leader** and **Campaign Manager** at the
same time.

All the stats from teams assigned to the Campaign Manager are recorded
against the Campaign Manager\'s results:
