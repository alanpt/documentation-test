# Timesheets

Timesheets are where the hours are tracked for your team members, can be
found in the Payroll section in Evergiving. Each day that a Fundraiser
or Campaign Manager is assigned to a team, they will automatically
record an entry in the team logs section with their assigned hours for
that day.\
If you need to modify a team member\'s hours, you do so by editing the
team and changing the hours assigned to the fundraiser or for previous
day\'s hours you can edit the hours via Timesheets - you can assign time
to non-fundraising hours that subtracts a certain number of hours from
their working hours for (head to Account -\> *Timesheet settings* to
create non-fundraising hours).

There are specific Timesheet exports that can be created.

Originally just for Fundraisers, through
<https://github.com/waysact/evergiving/issues/7178> we released Agent
timesheets. This release came with the following changes:

-   Create sub menu options for Agent and Fundraiser
-   On the Timesheets overview pages remove inactive users
-   On the Timesheets overview pages add a feature to manually trigger
    exports with active filters applied, adding a label next to the
    button \'Export Timesheets\'
-   On the Fundraiser Timesheet overview add filters for
    `External Reference number` (is present, is absent),
    `Campaign Manager (Team)` (is/isn\'t/is present/is absent),
    basically copy from
    [https://app.waysactstaging.com/en-AU/payroll/overview/current](https://app.waysactstaging.com/en-AU/payroll/overview/current){rel="nofollow"}
-   On the Agent Timesheet populate active agents and add columns for
    Team Hrs, Agent Hrs, Pause, Wait, Call, Preview, Dial, Talk, Wrap,
    and Time on Record (Campaign)
-   On the Timesheet export (exportBuilders/timesheet/new) add a filter
    condition for Fundraising Domain.
-   Rename Lock to \'Lock - Triggers timesheet exports where automated\'
