# Dashboards

Dashboards only display in Evergiving for Admin Operations users. You
can have multiple Dashboards and they will appear in tab format at the
top of the page. Each Dashboards has its own settings that can be edited
by clicking the gear icon beside the Dashboard name. This allows you to
create Dashboards that only source data from specific teams, campaigns
or fundraising domains. Individual charts can then be further restricted
with their own conditions.

A change introduced through
<https://github.com/waysact/evergiving/issues/7278> changes the date
association used in the Dashboard charts and through
<https://github.com/waysact/evergiving/issues/7276> we excluded inactive
users in the chart displays (not necessarily in the underlying data). 

**Creating Dashboards**

By default, there are no Dashboards as customers can create their own
custom Dashboard:

Just click Create Dashboard, add a Name, select whether the Dashboard
will be private to you or share with other roles. If the Dashboard is
for Fundraisers or Agents you can tick \"Limit data to frontliner\"[ to
only show those users data generated by them. Leave unchecked if you
want to create leader boards for competitions. You can also add
conditions to control the data the Dashboards accesses.\

**[Edit Dashboards]{._1UtoEz38sWwGTwxfqsfrrB}**

[To edit the date range of data displayed on the Dashboard, click on the
Calendar symbol to change the date range. To edit the Dashboard charts
or add new charts, click on the table symbol to switch to edit mode. To
add a chart to your Dashboard, click the \'Add Chart\' button and add a
label, select a chart type, a value (i.e. the main data source for the
chart) and add conditions if needed. You will see what the chart will
look like in the preview area. Once a chart is added to your Dashboard,
you can resize, move or remove an existing chart.\

**[Manage Dashboards]{._1UtoEz38sWwGTwxfqsfrrB}**

[From Manage Dashboards, you can see the Dashboard name, owner and the
roles the Dashboard is shared with. There are also shortcut icons for
\"View\", \"Edit\", \"Owner\", \"Copy\" and \"Delete\". The Copy feature
is for Super Admins to copy Dashboards from one account to another and
won\'t show for other roles.\

**[Data Sources]{._1UtoEz38sWwGTwxfqsfrrB}**

Note that there is a new page where you can look at an agent\'s
activity  `https://www.waysact.me/super/agent_activity` which, as the
URL implies, is only accessible to super admins. More information will
be built into it and it may help work out inconsistencies in Dashboard
data.

-   *Agent hours:* the sum of the time the agent spent logged in
-   *Agent Call Time*: Time spent on the phone, inc. dialing i.e.
    \`Dial\` AND \`Talk\` times
-   *Agent Dial Time*: Time on a call prior to connection with Donor
-   *Agent Pause Time*: Time logged in but not on a record
-   *Agent Preview Time*: Time spent on record before a call or if no
    call made
-   *Agent Talk Time*: Time on a call after connection with Donor
-   *Average Talk Time*: Average (dial time + talk time)
-   *Agent Wait Time:* Time spent between calls, including the time
    before the first and after the last call in a session/day (i.e.
    Pause time + Preview time + Wrap time)
-   *Average Agent Wait Time*: A[verage wait time per call i.e. total
    wait time / number of calls. It will also take sessions into
    account, for example if you log in, pause, log out that will also
    count even though no calls were made. So it's more or less the sum
    of (pause, preview, wrap) divided by number of
    calls.]{style="color: #1d1c1d; font-family: Slack-Lato, appleLogo, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #f8f8f8; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;"}

-   *Agent Wrap Time*: Time spent on record after a call is made
-   *Number of records*: records can be either pledges or leads so you
    need to add additional conditions in to specify exactly what data
    you are after.

Agent Preview/Wrap/Call/Dial/Talk/Pause time is also available to the
exports but it may not match exactly. In the Dashboard calls duration
are displayed in HH:MM:SS format (not DD:HH:MM). The times in the export
are in minutes (rounded).

**Restrict access to specific Dashboards**

To give access to specific dashboards only, set an Admin Operations user
with read only access to Dashboards and you\'ll see \"Restrict user to
these Dashboards only\" and you can select the user to specific
Dashboard/s.
