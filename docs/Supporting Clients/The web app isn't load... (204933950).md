# The web app isn\'t loading correctly (e.g. missing text and broken buttons)

If the Waysact web app isn\'t loading correctly then it\'s likely
that \'Private Browsing\' mode is enabled on the iPad.

**What is \'Private Browsing\' mode?**

\'Private Browsing\' mode is a special setting available in the Safari
web browser. It attempts to prevent websites from tracking you and also
disables various features, such as your search history and local
storage.

**Why does this matter?**

The Waysact web app depends on local storage for a number of reasons,
such as caching content and saving offline pledges. \'Private Browsing\'
mode disables local storage, which means that the Waysact web app cannot
function.

**How can I tell if \'Private Browsing\' mode is enabled?**

There are a number of tell-tale signs that \'Private Browsing\' is
enabled when using the Waysact web app. They are:

-   The menu bar is black instead of grey
-   Some buttons are unlabelled
-   Some buttons won\'t work
-   Some information text may be missing
-   Previously saved pledges won\'t be visible on the dashboard
-   Form fields may be incorrectly aligned
