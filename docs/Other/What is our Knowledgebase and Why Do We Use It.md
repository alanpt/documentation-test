## Why We Need a Knowledgebase

At our company, we recognize the importance of having a centralized source of information that our team can rely on. With so much information spread across different platforms, it's easy to get lost or waste time searching for what you need. Our knowledgebase solves this problem by bringing everything together in one place.

## How We Use Docs-as-Code

To make our knowledgebase work, we use a method called docs-as-code. This approach treats documentation like code, using version control and other best practices to make it more efficient and easy to manage. By using docs-as-code, we can easily collaborate on our documentation, track changes, and ensure that everything is up to date.

## Organizing Our Documentation with the Diátaxis Framework

The Diátaxis Framework is an important part of our knowledgebase. This framework breaks down documentation into smaller, more manageable pieces, making it easier to create and maintain. With Diátaxis, we can create a consistent structure for our documentation, making it easier for our team to find what they need.

## Hosting Our Knowledgebase with Material for Mkdocs

Our knowledgebase is hosted on a platform called Material for Mkdocs. This platform is based on markdown and yaml, making it simple and easy to use. The Material theme adds a clean, modern look and feel to our knowledgebase, making it more user-friendly.

## Using Markdown as a Backbone for Our Documentation

Markdown is the backbone of our documentation. It's a simple markup language that allows us to format text, add links, and create tables easily. Markdown is also easily readable in its raw form, making it simple to collaborate on and review.

## Wiki Editing and Folder Structure

To make it even easier to manage our documentation, we use plugins that give our knowledgebase wiki-like linking abilities. This makes it easy to move pages and images around without breaking links. We also use a folder structure to keep our documentation organized, making it easier for our team to find what they need.

## Managing Our Documentation with GitHub

Our knowledgebase is hosted on GitHub, which allows our team to easily collaborate on and manage the documentation. Using git, we can track changes, revert to previous versions, and manage different branches. And since GitHub is web-based, it's easy for our team to access the documentation from anywhere.

## Creating an External-Facing Support Site

Finally, we created an external-facing support site using GitHub Actions. This site is a duplicate of our internal knowledgebase, but with only audience-appropriate information. With only one source of truth, we can ensure that everything on the external-facing site is accurate and up to date. Plus, since the external-facing site is built from the same source as our internal knowledgebase, it's easy to update and maintain.

That's a brief overview of how our knowledgebase works and why we use it. If you have any questions or would like to learn more about our knowledgebase, please reach out to our documentation team.
