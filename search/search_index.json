This framework breaks down documentation into smaller, more manageable pieces, making it easier to create and maintain. With Di\u00e1taxis, we can create a consistent structure for our documentation, making it easier for our team to find what they need. Each article is either a 'how-to', 'tutorial', 'reference' or 'background/explanation'. </p>","tags":["Background"]},{"location":"Other/What%20is%20our%20Knowledgebase%20and%20how%20does%20it%20work/#building-our-knowledgebase-with-material-for-mkdocs","title":"Building our Knowledgebase with Material for Mkdocs","text":"<p>Our knowledgebase is built using a platform called Material for Mkdocs \u29c9. This platform works with markdown and yaml, making it simple and easy to use. When a markdown article is added or updated a GitHub actions tells Mkdocs to builds a new HTML/CSS/JS static site in Github Pages.

It's a simple markup language that allows us to format text, add links, and create tables easily. Markdown is also easily readable in its raw form, making it simple to collaborate on and review. And if we choose to move away from Mkdocs our documentation can move with us. Material for Mkdocs also comes with extra formatting and styles \u29c9 to enhance the articles. </p>","tags":["Background"]},{"location":"Other/What%20is%20our%20Knowledgebase%20and%20how%20does%20it%20work/#wiki-editing-and-folder-structure","title":"Wiki editing and folder structure","text":"<p>We use plugins that give our knowledgebase wiki-like linking abilities (also called Roamlinks).

We can track changes, revert to previous versions, and manage different branches. for those who will be doing a lot of editing, a tool like Obsidian \u29c9 is suggested as it's an easier environment to work with folders and images.</p>","tags":["Background"]},{"location":"Other/What%20is%20our%20Knowledgebase%20and%20how%20does%20it%20work/#next-up---creating-an-external-facing-support-site","title":"Next up - creating an external-facing support site","text":"<p>After the bulk of the articles are integrated here. We will use a Github Action to duplicate public-audience-appropriate articles to an Evergiving support website. This allows us to have only one source of truth, we can ensure that everything on the external-facing site is accurate and up to date.
